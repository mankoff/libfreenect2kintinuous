This script converts Kinect data captured with 'record' or
'kinect_record' to the format that kintinous expects. This script
should be run in a directory full of the '.z' file that are the output
from 'kinect_register'.

The kinect_register program is part of my fork of libfreenect
https://github.com/mankoff/libfreenect/blob/offline_register/examples/kinect_register.c
